        Welcome to the fitness challenge that was introduced by Mr. Nicalek. The goal of this "competition" is to have
        all the shops from each grade compete in a monthly step challenge.
        <br><br>You will track your steps through an app or fitbit everyday. By the end of
        the day take a screen shot and upload the information into this google form (shown below). We will take the
        information and upload it to an
        almost scoreboard like website that will hold all of the steps for each year and shop. Teachers can also
        participate in the activity because
        there will be a "No Shop" tab where you can visit the steps that the acedemic appartment have accomplished.
